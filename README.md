#Tuberculosis-Burdened-Countries-Tableau
<h2> This project focuses on analyzing the Global impact of Tuberculosis on each country. I have analyzed Regional Estimated Cases, Prevalence, Incidences, and Deaths of Tb (All forms) from the years 1990 to 2013.</h2>

<h3>Dashboard-1: Objective -
•	To compare the prevalence, incidence and mortality cases by regions.
•	To understand the severity of HIV in incident TB among different areas. • To observe the overall population trend over years.

Dashboard-2: Objective -
•	To observe average incidence and mortality TB cases with people who are HIVpositive among different regions.
•	To see the case detection rate trends of 6 regions, which is the ratio of the number of notified TB cases to the number of incident TB cases throughout the years.
•	To understand the top countries with highest estimated prevalence cases.
•	Show the proportions of average TB mortality percentage in different regions.
